# "Campus Life Super App"

# Project Overview

The **Campus Life Super App** is a multi-page, responsive web application designed to help college students stay connected with campus life. The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use hub where students can discover campus events, explore student resources, and stay informed about what’s happening around them.

This project was built as a final submission for a web development course and demonstrates the use of semantic HTML, responsive CSS, JavaScript interactivity, and external API integration.
